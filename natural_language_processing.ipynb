If you're curious, you can read more about them here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers. They are a particularly interesting data set because although the authorship of most of the essays has been long known since around the deaths of Hamilton and Madison, there was still some question about the authorship of certain articles into the 20th century.

    "### Part A: Initializing the language model\n",
    "\n",
    "First, implement the `__init__()` function in the `LanguageModel` class.  You should do this by building a two-level dictionary (in fact, we used the `collections.defaultdict` class, but this only make a few things a little bit shorter ... you are free to use it or not) `self.counts`, where the first key refers to the previous $n-1$ tokens, and the second key refers to the $n$-th token, and the value simply stores the count of the number of times this combination was seen.  For ease of use in later functions, we also created a `self.count_sums`, which contained the number of total times each $n-1$ combination was seen. We also build a `self.vocabulary` variable, which is just a `set` object containing all the unique words across the entire set of the input document.\n",

    "\n",
    "Next, implement the `perplexity()` function, which takes a text sample and computes the perplexity of this sample under the model.  We'll make a small tweak to the formula for perplexity in the notes because we are skipping the first $n-1$ tokens; since we only compute (#words - $(n-1)$) terms in the sum, you should divide by this denominator and not just #words). Be careful to not multiply together probabilities that get too small (hint: instead of taking the log of a large product, take the sum of the logs).\n",
